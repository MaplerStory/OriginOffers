        "longDescription": "Please Knock on My Door is a story-driven game which gives you control over a person suffering from depression and social anxiety. Help them get through work and reach out to friends while desperately trying to survive. Experience the frailty these themes bring and gain a better understanding of what it's like to live with some of the most common mental health issues today.<br><br> <b>Features:</b><br><li>A compelling and emotional story offering a voice to those who have none.</li><br><li>A fully voiced narrator who always has your best in mind. Probably.</li><br><li>A gameplay system which adds to the weight of every story-choice you make.</li><br><li>No \"Game Over\" screen, only alternate endings that tie into your choices.</li><br><li>A soundtrack that has been tailor-made for this experience.</li><br><li>Relationships that can be developed or broken.</li><br><li>Game length varies depending on your choices, ranging from 1-3 hours with enough content that you can come back and explore different parts of the narrative in consequent playthroughs.</li><br><li>As in real life, all of your choices are immediately saved. There is only one save.</li><br><br> <b>A note from the developer:</b><br> Please Knock on My Door has been in development since autumn 2014 and was initially supposed to be a 6 month exploration of my own experiences with depression. A word of caution; this is a game that might be difficult to play for those who have dealt with psychological issues such as depression and anxiety. That said, I truly believe that through entertainment we are able to understand topics that would otherwise be too foreign for us. I hope this game can help you better understand what it can be like to live with these issues, like it has already helped me.<br><br>",

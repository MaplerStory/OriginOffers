Despite fueling the engine of the British Empire, workers\u2019 lives are little more than legalized slavery while the top few percent profit from their labor. Living poor and dying young, the lower class unite in protest as a new kind of family, gangs, who turn to a life in the underworld in their struggle to survive. A struggle, until watchful Assassins come to their side and re-ignite an age-old conflict involving London\u2019s leaders that will echo throughout modern history, from the underground up.<br><br> Introducing Jacob Frye, who with the help of his twin sister Evie, will change the fate of millions in Assassin\u2019s Creed\u00ae Syndicate.

        "longDescription": "Penned by legendary comic book artist Joe Madureira (X-Men, Battle Chasers, The Ultimates), Darksiders: Wrath of War is set in a Post-Apocalyptic demon-ravaged world where evil forces have prematurely brought about the end of the time. Originally sent to oversee the destruction of Earth, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse have been betrayed by their master, stripped of their powers and cast down to Earth. Players take on the role of WAR - the first of the Four Horsemen - as he embarks on a brutal quest of vengeance and revenge against the forces that betrayed him with the help of his phantom steed RUIN. The first title from new THQ studio Vigil Games, Darksiders: Wrath of War features open-world exploration, a deep combat system and a huge arsenal of modern and mythical weapons.<br><br>Deceived by the forces of evil into prematurely bringing about the end of the world, War - the first Horseman of the Apocalypse - stands accused of breaking the sacred law by inciting a war between Heaven and Hell. Dishonored and stripped of his powers, War must return to Earth to search for the truth and punish those responsible.<br><br>Hunted by a vengeful group of Angels, War must take on the forces of Hell, forge uneasy alliances with the very demons he hunts, and journey across the ravaged remains of the Earth on his quest for vindication. But the answers he seeks will reveal a deep conspiracy in which War is just a pawn in the eternal battle between Heaven and Hell.<br><br>\u2022 <b>Apocalyptic Power of War</b> \u2013 Unleash the wrath of War with devastating supernatural abilities; an extreme arsenal of angelic, demonic, and earthly weapons; and his fiery red phantom steed, Ruin.<br><br>\u2022 <b>Epic Quest</b> \u2013 Battle across the wastelands and demon-infested dungeons of the decimated Earth, discovering new weapons, learning new abilities, and uncovering ancient relics to aid in your quest for vengeance and redemption.<br><br>\u2022 <b>Battle Heaven and Hell</b> \u2013 Destroy all who stand in your way - from war-weary angelic forces to Hell's hideous demon hordes, and confront the nefarious Destroyer, the very harbinger of Armageddon.<br><br>",

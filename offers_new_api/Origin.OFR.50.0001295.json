Joining a notable social group can also open up entirely new avenues for advancement. <br><br>  Whether posting on social networks via smartphone, leading a campus protest or researching new scientific discoveries, ambitious Sims will find a lot to engage them in University Life!<br><br>  <b>KEY FEATURES:</b><br><br>  &bull; <b>Major Excitement:</b> Each major comes with its own special Sim enhancement. Play with an anatomically-correct skeleton as part of the Science and Medicine major, or broadcast a radio show with the Communications major.<br><br>  &bull; <b>Be the Big Sim On Campus:</b> Joining a prominent social clique\u2014Jock, Nerd, or Rebel\u2014can lead to unique job specializations: Sports Agent, Video Game Designer, and Art Appraiser.

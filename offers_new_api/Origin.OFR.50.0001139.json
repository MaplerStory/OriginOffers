Start with your Sim, refining each shape, color and personality trait until you get the precise person that pleases you.

Guide your Sim\u2019s path through life, developing a career, finding love, and pursuing dreams and desires. Spending time with friends and family is just as important as mastering painting or accumulating knowledge.<br><br>\n\nTake things to the next level and record movies of your Sim\u2019s adventures and share them with the ever-growing and thriving community. With a huge catalog of expansion packs and fun objects to discover, there is no end to the possibilities awaiting you. It all begins here; your adventure awaits!<br><br>\n\n<b>KEY FEATURES:</b><br><br>\n\n&bull; <b>Customize Your Sim:</b> Mix and match a vast range of facial features and body types to get the look you want. Infuse your Sim with personality traits and help realize their dreams.<br><br>\n\n&bull; <b>Stage Your Own Extreme Makeover:</b> Decorate your Sim\u2019s home however you want, neat or messy. Use odd angles, create tall stacks of items, and apply your favorite self-made pattern to the walls and floors.<br><br>\n\n&bull; <b>Range From the Home:</b> Get out of the house and explore the lively and entertaining neighborhood for the first time. Be a part of the larger online community!",

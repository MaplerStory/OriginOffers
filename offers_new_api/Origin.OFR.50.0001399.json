        "longDescription": "The award-winning and BAFTA-nominated saga continues in The Banner Saga 2. Start your journey soon after the climactic events of The Banner Saga. The choices you made in the first game will affect who is alive and who isn\u2019t in this exciting sequel. <br><br>\n\n\nAs the world continues to crumble around you, only one bastion of hope remains. But getting there will require strong leadership, hard sacrifices, influencing new heroes and, as always, sound strategy in combat. <br><br>\n\n<b>Key Features:</b><br><br>\n\n<b>The epic Viking saga continues.</b> Enjoy beautiful 2D hand-drawn combat sequences and animations enhanced with special effects. And all the action is once again accompanied by an evocative score from Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory. <br><br>\n\n<b>Your choices drive the narrative.</b> The story continues based on choices made in the first game as well as hard choices you need to make in this one. <br><br>\n\n<b>New characters and a new race.</b> Continue your epic journey by interacting with new characters and a new race, the Horseborn. <br><br>\n\n<b>Improved strategic combat with consequences.</b> Dive into more strategic battle boards that enhance combat. You can, and will, lose characters permanently in combat and each one will weigh heavily on you long after the battle is over.<br><br>\n\n<b>The journey is as important as battle.</b> Your role in building and managing your caravan as you travel the vast landscape is critical, not only for your own survival, but the survival of an entire civilization.<br><br>",

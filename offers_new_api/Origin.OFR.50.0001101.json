You've got a Nanosuit, a versatile and advanced piece of military technology that helps you run faster and strike harder than your opponents. Use it in cloak or stealth mode to move about undetected.<br><br>\n\nHowever you use the Nanosuit, you'll get to fight your way: by going big and hitting hard, or surprising the enemy with a quick, calculated offense they never saw coming. Suit up and get moving.<br><br>\n\nThe Crysis Trilogy includes - Crysis, Crysis: Warhead, Crysis 2 Maximum Edition, Crysis 3 Digital Deluxe Edition and Crysis 3: The Lost Island.<br><br>\n\n<b>KEY FEATURES</b><br><br>\n\n<b>Single player campaign.</b> Follow the alien invasion of Earth in an extensive storyline across all three games in the Crysis Trilogy.<br><br>\n\n<b>Multiplayer focus.</b> Every game included in Crysis Trilogy features enormous replay value with multiplayer modes, maps and weapons.<br><br>\n\n<b>The Complete Crysis Experience.</b> Every moment is included in this must-have bundle. The original Crysis continues with the Crysis Warhead expansion, and the Crysis 3 action keeps coming in the Lost Island DLC.<br><br>\n\n<b>As of June 2014, our friends at GameSpy have ended all hosted game services, which will affect the online multiplayer aspect of this game. Because of technical challenges and concerns, we do not have a solution to keep these services up and running at this time, and online services for this game and other EA games on the GameSpy platform have ended. We are still investigating a range of options to restore official online functionality and multiplayer gameplay for these titles.

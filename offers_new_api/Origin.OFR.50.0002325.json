The Purity of Light, led by a charismatic man called  Rondar Lacaine, claims that mages are the source of all misfortune \u2013 and that only the second coming of Aonir, the father of all gods, will return Eo to its former splendor. \n<br><br>\nThe story takes place before the acclaimed SpellForce: The Order of Dawn.<br><br>\n<b>Features:<br>\n<li>Innovative Mix: Unique gameplay blending RTS and RPG naturally together.</li>\n<li>Create &amp; Customize: Create your own hero and choose between distinct skill trees.</li>\n<li>Build to Fight: Raise your own army and fight epic mass battles.</li>\n<li>Epic Storyline: Immerse yourself in a rich world  - Unravel the secrets behind the current situation in Nortander.

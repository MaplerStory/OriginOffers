        "longDescription": "Hacknet is an immersive, terminal-based hacking simulator. Dive down a rabbit hoIe as you follow the instructions of a recently deceased hacker, whose death may not have been the accident the media reports. Using old school command prompts and real hacking processes, you\u2019ll solve the mystery with minimal hand-holding and a rich world full of secrets to explore.<br><br>\n\nBit, a hacker responsible for creating the most invasive security system on the planet, is dead. When he fails to reconnect to his system for 14 days, his failsafe kicks in, sending instructions in automated emails to a lone user. As that user, it\u2019s up to you to unravel the mystery and ensure that Hacknet-OS doesn't fall into the wrong hands.<br><br>\n\nExploring the volatile nature of personal privacy, the prevalence of corporate greed and the hidden powers of hackers on the internet, Hacknet delivers a true hacking simulation and allows beginners to get a grasp of the real-world applications and commands found throughout the game.<br><br>\n\n<b>Ultimate Edition includes:</b><br><br>\nHacknet<br>\nHacknet Labyrinths<br>\nHacknet Official Soundtrack<br>\nHacknet Labyrinths Official Soundtrack<br><br>\n\n<b>Key Features:<br><br>\n\nReal hacking.</b> Based on actual UNIX commands, Hacknet focuses on real hacking, not the Hollywood-style version of it. This creates a truly immersive experience and puts players right in the thick of trying to break through the firewalls.<br><br>\n\n<b>Unlock the mystery of Bit.</b> A hacker is dead and the media reports don\u2019t add up. When you are contacted by his \u201cghost\u201d - an automated failsafe system - you\u2019re drawn into the dark and murky world of underground hackers.<br><br>\n\n<b>Full immersion.</b> You are thrust into a persistent virtual world with no \u201clevels\u201d or obvious game elements to break the illusion. Follow the guidance of the emails from Bit or just dive down the rabbit hole, chasing down clues and snippets of information you find as you explore different systems.<br><br>\n\n<b>Accessible but uncompromising.</b> While it doesn\u2019t hold your hand, the design of the game and the learning curve enables those with no prior terminal experience to enjoy it while delighting those in the know.<br><br>\n\n<b>Killer tunes.</b> Hack to the beat of a soundtrack featuring underground artists including Carpenter Brut (Hotline Miami) and Remi Gallego (AKA The Algorithm).

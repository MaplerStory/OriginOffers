Investigate the lives of citizens to find those responsible for a series of terror attacks. Information from the internet, personal communications and private files are all accessible to you. But, be warned, the information you supply will have consequences\u2026<br><br>\nOrwell is a new governmental security program that has the power to survey the online presence of citizens and access their personal communication and technology devices. But to successfully profile suspects and protect the privacy of citizens, Orwell needs an impartial human researcher\u2014someone operating outside of the Nation who can interpret relevant chunks of data and make decisions when conflicts arise.\nSelected from thousands of candidates, you have been chosen as Orwell\u2019s first human researcher. And when a terror attack rocks the Nation\u2019s capital city of Bonton, Orwell is immediately put to the test.<br><br>\nRequired to investigate the web pages, blog posts, chat messages, files and private information that Orwell retrieves and serves up, you will help the Nation create personal profiles of suspects and uncover the perpetrators.<br><br>\nBut are these people really terrorists? What does the information you reveal to Orwell say about them? What if you find out things about them that not even their loved ones know? What is the real price of maintaining the security that the Nation is yearning for?<br><br>\n<b>Key Features</b><br><br>\n<b>Investigate the digital lives of citizens. </b>Search web pages, scour through social media posts, dating site profiles, news articles and blogs to find those responsible for a series of terror attacks.<br><br>\n<b>Invade the private lives of suspects. </b>Listen in on chat communications, read personal emails, hack PCs, pull medical files, make connections. Find the information you need to know.<br><br>\n<b>Determine the relevance of information. </b>Only the information you provide will be seen by the security forces and acted upon. You decide what gets seen and what does not and influence how the suspects will be perceived.<br><br>\n<b>Secure the freedom of the Nation. </b>Find the terrorists so the citizens of the Nation can sleep safe, knowing Orwell is watching over them.<br><br>",

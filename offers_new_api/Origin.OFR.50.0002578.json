        "longDescription": "Build and manage a maximum security prison. As the sun casts it\u2019s early morning rays on a beautiful patch of countryside the clock starts ticking. You\u2019ve got to crack on and build a holding cell to detain the job\u00ad lot of maximum security prisoners that are trundling to your future prison on their yellow bus. As your workmen lay the last brick you don\u2019t have a moment to let them rest as they need to get started on the first proper cell block so you can make room for the next prisoner intake. Once they\u2019ve all got a place to lay their weary heads the fun can really start.<br><br>\n\nYou\u2019ll need a canteen, infirmary and a guard room, oh, and don\u2019t forget to plumb in a toilet, or things will get messy. But what about a workout area? Or solitary confinement cells? Or an execution chamber?<br><br>\n\nInspired by Dungeon Keeper, Dwarf Fortress and Theme Hospital and with over 1 million players having spent time inside, Prison Architect is the world\u2019s best lock-\u00adem-\u00adup.<br><br>\n\n<b>Story mode.</b> Prison Architect opens with the story of Edward, a man facing the electric chair for committing a crime of passion. This is followed by four additional chapters focusing on different characters and aspects of prison life. From Mafia Dons to power-crazed senators, Prison Architect has them all! To bring these characters to life, Introversion teamed up with award winning professional writer Chris Hastings, producing an enthralling tale of corruption and human misery set against the background of the modern prison-industrial complex.<br><br>\n\n<b>Escape mode.</b> Finished your supermax? Got guard dogs roving every corridor and prisoners eating out of your hand? Now you can live the horror by firing up escape mode and play as a prisoner hell-bent on getting the hell out of Dodge. Dig a tunnel, go for the armory or start a riot and slip out in the chaos, it\u2019s entirely up to you!<br><br>",

        "longDescription": "From the Producer of the original Fallout comes Wasteland\u2122 2, the sequel to the first-ever post-apocalyptic computer RPG.<br><br>\n\nThe Wasteland's hellish landscape is waiting for you to make your mark... or die trying. With over 80 hours of gameplay, you will deck out your Desert Ranger squad with the most devastating weaponry this side of the fallout zone, test the limits of your strategy skills, and bring justice to the Wasteland.<br><br>\n\n<b>FEATURES</b><br><br>\n\n<b>One Size Does Not Fit All.</b> Don't feel like finding the key for a door? Pick the lock, bash it down with your boot, or just blow it open!<br><br>\n\n<b>Decision Making... with Consequences.</b> With both short and long term reactivity, your choices ripple outwards, changing the game's events and forever altering the lives of those in the Wasteland.<br><br>\n\n<b>Huge & Customizable.</b> Hundreds of characters. Thousands of variations on your Rangers' appearance. Over 150 weapons. No two players will have the same experience.<br><br><br>\n\n\n<b>DIRECTOR'S CUT NEW FEATURES</b><br><br>\n\n<b>Complete Graphics Overhaul.</b> Rebuilt in Unity 5, Wasteland\u2122 2's environments and characters have been updated to take advantage of the latest graphics technologies.<br><br>\n\n<b>Perks & Quirks.</b> Customize your squad even more! Perks & Quirks are special personality traits you can use to give your characters even more life, with their own unique bonuses... and drawbacks.<br><br>\n\n<b>Precision Strikes.</b> Fire on your enemies and debilitate them with tactical attacks! Cripple a leg to slow an enemy down, fire on their gun to blast it to bits, or aim for the head to knock them senseless \u2013 or blow it clean off.<br><br>\n\n<b>Expanded Voice Over.</b> Over 8,000 lines of new voice-over dialog have been added for the game's characters and companions, bringing the Wasteland to life like never before.<br><br><br>\n\n\n<b>REVIEWS</b><br><br>\n\n\u201cThis really does feel like Fallout 4, if Fallout were to go back to its CRPG roots.\u201d<br>\n<b>TotalBiscuit, The Cynical Brit</b><br><br>\n\n\u201cAlong with Bard's Tale, Wasteland\u2122 was one of the games that made me want to make games. I was privileged that Brian gave me the opportunity to work on Fallout, and I have missed those games. Getting to play Wasteland\u2122 2 is like getting to return to your past and finding out that it is still as fun as you remember.\u201d<br>\n<b>Feargus Urquhart, CEO Obsidian & Lead Designer Fallout 2</b><br><br>\n\n\u201cInXile can be really proud. Not only did they pave the Kickstarter road for CRPGs, they over-delivered with the end result and crafted a rich experience which will keep me busy for a long time.\u201d<br>\n<b>Swen Vincke, Creative Director of Divinity: Original Sin</b><br><br><br>\n\n\n<b>AWARDS</b><br><br>\n\nGame of the Year \u2013 PC World 2014<br><br><br>\n\n\n<b>GAME EDITIONS</b><br><br>\n\n<b>Classic Edition</b><br><br>\n\n\u2022 A free copy of Wasteland\u2122 1 - The Original Classic.<br>\n\u2022 Mark Morgan's Wasteland\u2122 2 original soundtrack in digital format.<br>\n\u2022 An incredible digital concept art book showcasing many of the world's characters and environments.<br><br>\n\n<b>Digital Deluxe Edition</b><br><br>\n\n\u2022 A free copy of Wasteland\u2122 1 - The Original Classic.<br>\n\u2022 A free copy of The Bard's Tale.<br>\n\u2022 Three digital novellas set in The Wasteland\u2122 world.<br>\n\u2022 Mark Morgan's Wasteland\u2122 2 original soundtrack in digital format.<br>\n\u2022 An incredible digital concept art book showcasing many of the world's characters and environments.<br><br>",

The result is a deeply replayable experience that arises naturally from your actions throughout the game.<br><br><b>A New Take on Combat.</b> With the Crisis system, combat is more than just bashing your enemies. Plan your way through hand-crafted set-pieces which combine battles with environmental puzzles, social interaction, stealth, and more.",

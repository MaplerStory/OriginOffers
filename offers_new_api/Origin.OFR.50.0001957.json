        "longDescription": "DEAD IN VINLAND is a survival/management game with RPG and adventure elements, and is the sequel of DEAD IN BERMUDA.<br><br>\n\nExiled on a faraway, unknown land, lead Eirik and his family on their quest to survive. <br>\nManage their physical and mental health, explore the island, organize your camp and deal with other human beings. Some will help you, if you want, and some will be less docile\u2026 <br>\nUnveil the esoteric mysteries of Vinland. They could save your life\u2026 or lead you to your demise.<br><br>\n\n<b>KEY FEATURES</b><br>\nDeep survival management simulation: Resources, food, health, diseases, water, weather\u2026<br><br>\n\nChallenging and turn based: Take your time and make the best decisions to adapt to the situation!<br><br>\n\nBuild your camp! 14 camp stations to build and 130+ upgrades.<br><br>\n\nLive your own adventure: 14 playable characters, dialogue choices, personal stories, betrayals, romances\u2026<br><br>\n\nStory-driven: Discover an unknown island and unveil its many secrets to help you defeat the infamous tyrant Bj\u00f6rn \u201cHeadcleaver\u201d.<br><br>\n\nNon linear quest system, impactful dialogue choices, dynamic endings.<br><br>\n\nFull RPG system: usable objects, skills to upgrade, characters to level-up, character traits...<br><br>\n\nTactical turn-based combat system: a new tactical turn-based combat system, level ups, skills, powered by a deep characters traits system.<br><br>\n\n<b>DEAD IN WHAT?</b><br>\nWe started the big adventure with Dead In Bermuda. From the start, we wanted to build a world where all the games in the series would fit. If you played DiB, you may have noticed... Strange... Things. With no real explanations. More explanations will come in DiV, which is not a direct sequel but shares the same base gameplay and backstory.<br><br>\n\nEach game is totally independant, you won't miss a thing if you haven't played DiB, but in the end you'll learn in each game more about a common thread that ties everything together.<br><br>\n\nGameplay-wise, while keeping the same basic original gameplay we developed in DiB, DiV is a major improvement in nearly all aspects: More characters, more stories, deeper survival mechanics, more crafts, more to explore, more replayability... And other surprises!<br><br>\n\n<b>ABOUT US</b><br>\nCCCP is a small french development studio. For a dozen years, we've kept on surviving by making educational games, but now we want to focus on making games that we'd like to play ourselves, especially MANAGEMENT and RPG games, with NARRATIVE elements. We want to make CHALLENGING and MEANINGFUL SOLO, PREMIUM games, where the player has to THINK and DISCOVER by himself.<br>",

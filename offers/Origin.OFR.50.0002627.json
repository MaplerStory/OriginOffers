The heavens opened and stars fell like beacons into the pitch-black world, and they were known as \"Embers\". Powerful and wise druids of a primordial race, \"the Lightbringers\", roamed the land searching for this luminous matter. They performed a ritual of awakening to call the \"Embers\" out of their deep sleep. Suddenly the world became bright, and the veil of darkness was lifted. The Embers were the embodiment of magical flame, light, and life, but as word spread about the sheer power of the Embers, they came to be hunted and captured\u2026and so the War for Ember began.<br><br>\n\nA passion project 10 years in the making, Ember is a homage to classic role-playing games (RPG).
